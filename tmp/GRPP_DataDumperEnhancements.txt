Changes for GRPP dumpers:


IMPORTANT --> set DatDumper configuration in GeneralConfiguration.pm
(for all): change base names accordignly to this file

<MARKER_NAME>_rec-xyz.out:
  · Include number of satellites used for position estimation --> OK
  · Additional configuration for this feature --> OK
  · ENU increments --> review documentation for commiting this --> OK
    - ENU incrments respect MARKER reference position (lat, lon) --> OK
    - If no marker reference position is provided, do it with the mean receiver position or other statistical measurement --> OK
  · Differences against reference station from data file --> ABORT
  · Remove Observation epoch status information from header --> OK

<MARKER_NAME>_rec-lsq_report.out.:
  · Include residuals (maybe in another dumper file)**
  · More explanatory names for columns --> ABORT
  · Include number of obsrvation equations --> OK
  · Include number of parameters to estimate --> OK
  · Compute degrees of freedom --> OK

<SAT_SYS>_sat-obs_data.out:
  · Include observed num of sats --> ABORT
  · Include (for each observation) num sats with no-NULL measurement --> OK

<SAT_SYS>_sat-nav_xyz.out:
  · Include propagated sat coordinates due to signal time of flight (to receiver) --> OK
  · Check for beign including all observed sats at the epoch --> OK
  · Include num of observed sats --> ABORT
  · Include num of sats with available navigation coordinates --> OK
  · Change "Sat-Status" column name by something like: "Nav-Status" --> OK

<SAT_SYS>_sat-los_data.out:
  · Include num of observed satellites --> ABORT
  · Include num of satellites with no-NULL measurment --> ABORT
  · Include num of satellites to LSQ algorithm --> ABORT


*New file:
<MARKER_NAME>-DOP.out:
  · Include here:

    Being Qxx (Co-variance matrix) = [ [qxx qxy qxz qxt],
                                       [qyx qyy qyz qyt],
                                       [qzx qzy qzz qzt],
                                       [qtx qty qtz qtt] ];

    - GDOP -> Geometric DOP  = sqrt( qxx + qyy + qzz + qtt );
    - PDOP -> Position DOP   = sqrt( qxx + qyy + qzz );
    - TDOP -> Time DOP       = sqrt( qtt );

    And, Qenu = R' x Qxyz x R = [ [qee, qen, qeu],
                                  [qne, qnn, qnu],
                                  [que, qun, quu] ];

    Being R = [ [-sin(lat), -sin(lat)cos(lon), cos(lat)cos(lon)],
                [ cos(lon), -sin(lat)sin(lon), cos(lat)sin(lon)],
                [        0,          cos(lat),         sin(lat)] ];

    - HDOP -> Horizontal DOP = sqrt( qee + qnn );
    - VDOP -> Vertical DOP   = sqrt( quu );

*** Why dont we make a dumper file with number of satellites???!!!
  · Per $sat_sys
    · Per epoch:
      - Observed satellites --> OK
      - Satellites with no null observations  --> OK
      - Satellites with navigation valid data --> OK
      - Satellites to LSQ algorithm           --> OK

** The idea of the residual vector file would be:
Epoch   SAT_ID_1    SAT_ID_2   SAT_ID_3   SAT_ID_4    SAT_ID_5 --> all possible LSQ sats
21654    45.23       45874.2     NULL       745.2       NULL
...
