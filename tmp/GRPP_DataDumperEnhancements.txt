Changes for GRPP dumpers:

(for all): change base names accordignly to this file

<MARKER_NAME>_rec-xyz.out:
  · Include number of satellites used for position estimation
  · ENU increments --> review documentation for commiting this
  · Differences against reference station from data file
  · Remove Observation epoch status information

<MARKER_NAME>_rec-lsq_report.out.:
  · Include residuals (maybe in another dumper file)**
  · More explanatory names for columns

<SAT_SYS>_sat-obs_data.out:
  · Include observed num of sats
  · Include (for each observation) num sats with no-NULL measurement

<SAT_SYS>_sat-nav_xyz.out:
  · Include propagated sat coordinates due to signal time of flight (to receiver)
  · Check for beign including all observed sats at the epoch
  · Include num of observed sats
  · Include num of sats with available navigation coordinates
  · Change "Sat-Status" column name by something like: "Nav-Status"

<SAT_SYS>_sat-los_data.out:
  · Include num of observed satellites
  · Include num of satellites with no-NULL measurment
  · Include num of satellites to LSQ algorithm

*** Why dont we make a dumper file with number of satellites???!!!
  · Per epoch:
    - Observed satellites
    - Satellites with no null observations
    - Satellites with navigation valid data
    - Satellites to LSQ algorithm

** The idea of the residual vector file would be:

Epoch   SAT_ID_1    SAT_ID_2   SAT_ID_3   SAT_ID_4    SAT_ID_5 --> all possible LSQ sats 
21654    45.23       45874.2     NULL       745.2       NULL
