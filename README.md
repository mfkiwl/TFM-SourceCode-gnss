# TFM-SourceCode
Repository for managing and develop GNSS RINEX Post-Processing (GRPP) and GNSS Service Performance Analyzer (GSPA) tools.

These tools are initially dedicated to attend the positioning performance assessment of the final master thesis:

GNSS Open Service Case Study: Development of SW Tools for Assessing GPS and GALILEO Positioning Performances by Means of Post-Processing Single-Frequency Pseudorange Observations.

This master thesis belongs to the student Pablo Pinto Santos of the Superior Technical School in Geodesy, Cartography and Land Surveying Engineering (ETSIGCT) of the Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV). 

The hereafter tools and source code have been produced by the student. The end objective of this repository is to serve as a control version for the tool developing in order provide it as an open-source tool in a future release for any user willing to make use of it.

Disclaimer: Be aware that at this stage the tools are not prepared to be downloaded and executed comfortably. As mentioned, this will be assessed in the next release.
